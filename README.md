# Confetti-Cuisine-Final-Project-akola5
This Phase 3 of the project gave me in depth understanding of how a web application should be designed.
I also gained knowledge on how to debug errors and code in nodejs and other programming languages.
I got stuck in few places where i got a chance to understand more and overcome the errors.
I also got to learn about heroku for the first time.
Overall, I enjoyed working on this project and happy for the knowledge i gained.
